In Hackmeetings, local hacklabs and other similar groups  take part in a multitude of activities related to Internet and new technologies, from a political point of view and social, like conferences, round tables, demonstrations, factories and other activities- all of them generally open to the public.

The main reason for this is to present movements like free software, new technologies like wireless and the problems derived from the new technologies like lack of privacy, besides also to spread techniques and applied computer science knowledge of high level.

Meeting places are usually social centers okupados, and public. Hackmeeting is inspired by the event HackIt that began 1998 in Italy, although through the years it has been evolving until obtaining its own identity. It also exists as hackmeeting international, by the alias transhackmeeting, which celebrated its first edition in Croatia.
