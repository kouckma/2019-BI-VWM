Alpha\B2 Canum Venaticorum variables are main sequence variable stars of spectral class B8p to A7p.  They display strong magnetic fields and have strong silicon, strontium, and chromium spectral lines.  Their brightness typically varies by 0.01 to 0.1 magnitudes over the course of 0.5 to 160 days.

The prototype, and most well known of these variables is Cor Caroli (  CVn) which has fluctuations in brightness of 0.1 magnitudes with a period of 5.47 days.
