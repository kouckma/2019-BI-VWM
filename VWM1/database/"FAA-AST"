FAA/AST is the FAA's Office of Commercial Space Transportation.

The Federal Aviation Administration's Office of the Associate Administrator for Commercial Space Transportation (AST) is the U.S. government organization responsible for regulating and facilitating the safe operations and international competitiveness of the U.S. commercial space transportation industry.

It is responsible for licensing private space vehicles and spaceports within the US.
This is in contrast with NASA that is a research and development agency of the US Federal Government, and as such neither operates nor regulates the commercial space transportation industry. The regulatory responsibility for the industry falls to the Federal Aviation Administration, which is a regulatory agency. NASA does, however, often use launch satellites and spacecraft on vehicles developed by private companies.
