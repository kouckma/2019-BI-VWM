In mathematics, a cusp neighborhood is defined as a set of points near a cusp.

Cusp neighborhood for a Riemann surface.
The cusp neighborhood for a hyperbolic Riemann surface can be defined in terms of its Fuchsian model.
 
Suppose that the Fuchsian group G contains a parabolic element g. For example, the element  where



is a parabolic element.  Note that all parabolic elements of  are conjugate to this element. That is, if  is parabolic, then  for some . 

The set

;

where  is the upper half-plane has

;

for any 
where  is understood to mean the group generated by g.  That is,   acts properly discontinuously on U. Because of this, it can be seen that the projection of U onto H/G is thus
.

Here, E is called the neighborhood of the cusp corresponding to g. 

Note that the hyperbolic area of E is exactly 1, when computed using the canonical Poincar\E9 metric.  This is most easily seen by example: consider the intersection of U defined above with the fundamental domain 
;
of the modular group, as would be appropriate for the choice of T as the parabolic element.  When integrated over the volume element
;
the result is trivially 1.  Areas of all cusp neighborhoods are equal to this, by the invariance of the area under conjugation.
