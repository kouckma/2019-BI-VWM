The process of boosting the altitude of an artificial satellite, to increase the time until its orbit will decay and it re-enters the atmosphere. For example, the International Space Station is given a reboost by the Space Shuttle every time it visits, because it is in a low-Earth orbit which experiences significant atmospheric drag.
