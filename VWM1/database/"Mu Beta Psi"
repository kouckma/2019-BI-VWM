Mu Beta Psi National Honorary Musical Fraternity is a service and music fraternity with chapters and colonies at universities throughout the United States. Founded in 1925 at North Carolina State University by the director of bands, Major Percy Walter "Daddy" Price, this group began as a male-only, honor fraternity for band students.  However, it soon spread to a number of colleges throughout the southern United States and allowed women to join the group in the early 1960s.  By the early 2000s, the fraternity had spread to several colleges through the eastern United States, both in the north and south.

Although the name contains National Honorary Musical Fraternity, Mu Beta Psi views itself as primarily a music service group.  Several of the chapters run scholarship programs and pride themselves on giving service to their music departments.
