Clonbrook is a village in the Demerara-Mahaica region of Guyana. The village itself has a population of about 1,000-2,000. The village is located along the East Coast Highway and is about 20 miles from Georgetown and about 4 miles from Mahaica. It also consists of the village of Bee Hive.

 Demographics .
Historically, Clonbrook was almost 100% Indo-Guyanese, but today, that has changed due to migration within the country.  The village of Clonbrook has a population of about 1,000 and most residents are of Indian Descent (Indo-Guyanese), however in recent years substantial Black migration has occurred.  As a result of migration, many new houses have been constructed near the Public Road, also known as the East Coast Highway.  Like many other Guyanese villages, Clonbrook is somewhat ethnically segregated:  Some sections have a black majority, while others have an Indian majority.  This village is well known for having friendly people, and racial disturbances do not occur.

 Education .
Clonbrook has one school.  However, during the 1960s and 1970s many residents did not take their education seriously, resulting in a literacy rate of only 84%, below the national average of 98%. (Source: Random Survey of 100 random people conducted in 2005).
