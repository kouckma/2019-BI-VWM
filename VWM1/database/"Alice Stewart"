Dr Alice Mary Stewart (n\E9e Naish) (4 October 1906, Sheffield, England to 23 June 2002, Oxford, England) was a physician and epidemiologist specialising in social medicine and the effects of radiation on health. 

Her pioneering study of x-rays as a cause of childhood cancer (1953) was initially regarded as unsound, but her findings were eventually accepted worldwide and the use of medical x-rays during pregnancy and early childhood was curtailed as a result. 

Her most famous investigation (working with Professor Thomas Mancuso of the University of Pittsburgh) was among employees in the Hanford plutonium production plant, Washington, which found a far higher incidence of radiation-induced ill health than was noted in official studies. Sir Richard Doll, the epidemiologist respected for his work on smoking-related illnesses, attributed her anomalous findings to a "questionable" statistical analysis supplied by her assistant, George Kneale, but today her account is valued as a response to the perceived bias in reports produced by the nuclear industry.

In 1986 she was added to the roll of honour of the Right Livelihood Foundation, an annual award supported by the Swedish Parliament.
