The Virgin of Zesh & The Tower of Zanid is a 1982 collection of two science fiction novels by L. Sprague de Camp. Both works are part of his Viagens Interplanetarias series and of its subseries of stories set on the fictional planet Krishna. The collection was first published in paperback by Ace Books in 1982. It was issued as the fourth volume of the standard edition of the Krishna novels, and its component parts were at the time of publication the fourth and fifth Krishna novels, chronologically. Afterwards, publication of The Prisoner of Zhamanak (1982) and The Bones of Zora (1983) made them the fifth and seventh Krishna novels, respectively.

 Setting .
The planet Krishna is de Camp's premier creation in the Sword and Planet genre, representing both a tribute to the Barsoom novels of Edgar Rice Burroughs and an attempt to "get it right", reconstructing the concept logically, without what he regarded as Burroughs' biological and technological absurdities.

 Trivia .
The titles of all of de Camp's "Krishna" novels have a "Z" in them, a practice he claimed to have devised to keep track of them. Short stories in the series do not follow the practice, nor do Viagens Interplanetarias works not set on Krishna.
