The Castle of Antoing is one of Belgium most original and well-known castles. It was first mentioned in the 12th century. Although the castle dates from the 13th and 15th century, it was redesigned in neo-gothic style in the 19th century by the famous French architect Viollet-le-Duc (1814-1879). Other Belgian castles built in such style include Faulx-les-Tombes and La Posterie (in Courriere) both about 15km south of Namur.

The castle of Antoing first belonged to the powerful Melun family, then passed in 1634 to the Princes de Ligne by inheritance. The Ligne family also owns the magnificient castle of Beloeil in the same province.
