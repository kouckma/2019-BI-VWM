It is No secret is a Christian-country song composed by Carl Stuart Hamblen in 1950's.

Lyrics.

It is no secret, 
what God can do. 
What he's done for others, 
He'll do for you. 
With arms wide open, 
He'll welcome you. 
It is no secret, 
what God can do. 

 History .

When Hamblin quit drinking thanks to Billy Graham he began to lose favor with Hollywood. He was ultimately fired by the radio station when he refused to accept a beer company as a sponsor. Hard times were upon him. During his struggle, John Wayne took him aside and told him all your troubles started when you "got religion" and asked if it was worth it all. Hamblen answered simply, "Yes". Then he said, "You liked your booze so much. Don't you ever miss it?" And the answer was, "No". John then said, "I don't understand how you could give it up so easily." And  Hamblen response was, "It's no big secret. All things are possible with God." To this John said, "That's a catchy phrase. You should write a song about it."
