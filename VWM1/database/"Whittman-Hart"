WHITTMANHART is a services company dealing with digital communications.

Founded by Bob Bernard in the Chicago area, it specialized first in AS/400 IT consulting. It grew steadily, for about 15 years, including some acquisitions. The company went public in 1996. In 1997, the Fortune Magazine named it one of the fastest growing companies in the US.

The company acquired US Web/CKS, a California-based web consulting firm, after which Bob Bernard decided to rename the business marchFIRST, inc., the business was re-corporated on March 1st, 2000. This was at the height of the dot-com boom in 2000.

However, the company failed later that year, shuttering dozens of locations throughout the USA. It changed owners up to 2003 when it was reacquired by Bob Bernard. It still operates, but is not publicly traded.

In the last couple of years (2005-2006) WHITTMANHART has acquired numerous organizations including Ohio based Infinis Inc, Philadelphia based Insight Interactive Group Inc, Maryland based Estco.net, LLC, Chicago based Vision Enterprises, and Los Angeles based DNA Studio. The company has also established itself as one of the top performers in Interactive Marketing and Advertising, Corporate Performance Management, Banking Solutions and Search Engine Optimization spaces.
