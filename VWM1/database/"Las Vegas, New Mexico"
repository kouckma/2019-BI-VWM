Las Vegas is a city in San Miguel County, New Mexico,  United States. Once two separate towns, West Las Vegas ("Old Town") and East Las Vegas ("New Town"), divided by the Gallinas River, retain distinct characters and separate, rival, school districts. The population was 14,565 at the 2000 census. It is the county seat of San Miguel County.

Las Vegas is the home of New Mexico Highlands University. It is also a venue used by the IBNA for teacher training, perhaps due to the proximity of the Armand Hammer United World College of the American West.

Las Vegas is sometimes mistaken for Las Vegas, Nevada.  

History.
Las Vegas was established in 1835 after a group of settlers received a land grant from the Mexican government. The town was laid out in the traditional Spanish Colonial style, with a central plaza surrounded by buildings which could serve as fortifications in case of attack. Las Vegas soon prospered as a stop on the Santa Fe Trail. During the Mexican-American War in 1846, Stephen W. Kearny delivered an address at the Plaza of Las Vegas claiming New Mexico for the United States.

When the railroad arrived in 1880 it set up shop one mile east of the Plaza, creating a separate, rival New Town (as in Albuquerque). During the railroad era Las Vegas boomed, quickly becoming one of the largest cities in the American southwest. Turn-of-the-century Las Vegas featured all the modern amenities, including an electric street railway, the "Duncan Opera House" at the NE corner of 6th Street and Douglas Avenue, a Carnegie library, a major Harvey House hotel, and the New Mexico Normal School (now NMHU). Since the decline of the railroad began in the 1950s the city's population has remained relatively constant.
