Capital Punishment Organization, most commonly referred to as CPO, was a gangster rap duo which consisted of artists known as Lil Nation (Vince Edwards) and DJ Train (Clarence Lars).  They released a single album in 1990, To Hell and Black, which was produced by MC Ren of N.W.A. fame and distributed by Capitol Records.  To Hell and Black peaked at 33 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums Billboard charts. 

DJ Train, who had worked with artists such as MC Ren and J.J. Fad, died of smoke inhalation in a house fire on June 25, 1994.  

Lil Nation has since began identifying himself as (Tha) Boss Hogg, or "CPO" in the singular form.  CPO/Boss Hogg continues to make rap appearances, including the 1994 original soundtrack to Above the Rim, hyphy artist E-A-Ski on his 1998 album, and the 2000 self-titled album by Tha Eastsidaz.
