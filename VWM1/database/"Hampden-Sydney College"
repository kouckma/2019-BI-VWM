Hampden-Sydney College is a liberal arts college for men located in Hampden-Sydney, Virginia.  Founded in 1775, Hampden-Sydney is the 10th oldest college in the United States and one of only four remaining mainstream all-men's liberal arts colleges in the United States (the others are Wabash College, Deep Springs College, and Morehouse College).  

For nearly two and a half centuries, Hampden-Sydney College has been dedicated to the goal of forming  good men and good citizens in an atmosphere of sound learning. 

Overview.

Hampden-Sydney enrolls over 1,100 students from thirty states and several foreign countries.  The College enrolls young men of character and ability who will benefit from a rigorous and traditional liberal arts curriculum.  

The school is one of two remaining traditional all-male colleges. The school's mission is to "form good men and good citizens." As such, Hampden-Sydney has one of the strictest Honor Codes of any college or university. Upon entering as a student, each man pledges that he will not lie, cheat, steal, nor tolerate those who do while he is a student at Hampden-Sydney. This simply-worded code of behavior applies to the students lives on or off campus.  Though it is strict, the justice system is student-run, allowing for a true trial of peers, adjudicated by a court that is both thorough and compassionate to both the college and their fellow students.

Every student must prepare for and take the Rhetoric Proficiency Exam, a three-hour essay that is graded upon coherence of argument, quality of argument, style in which the argument is presented, and grammatical correctness.  To prepare, the college requires each student to pass two Rhetoric classes that are usually taken the first two semesters a student is at Hampden-Sydney. After graduating, many alumni have stated that the the Rhetoric Program was the most valuable aspect in the Hampden-Sydney information. Indeed, knowing how to write well makes one invaluable to any workplace or organization.

History.

Classes at Hampden-Sydney began in temporary wooden structures on November 10, 1775, on the eve of the American War of Independence; This makes Hampden-Sydney College the nation's 10th oldest college.  The College has been in continuous operation since that date, and despite the difficult and financially-strapped first years resulting from the Revolutionary War, the College survived with sufficient viability to be granted a charter by the Virginia General Assembly in 1783   the oldest private charter in the South.

Hampden-Sydney College derives its name from John Hampden (1594-1643) and Algernon Sidney (1622-1683).  Hampden lost his life in the battle of Chalgrove Field during the English Civil War.  Sydney, who wrote Discourses Concerning Government, was beheaded by order of Charles II following a failed attempt to overthrow the king.  The college was founded by alumni and people affiliated with Princeton University.  These proponents of religious and civil liberties were much admired by the founders of the College, all of whom were active supporters of the cause of American independence. Both Patrick Henry and James Madison were elected trustees in the founding period before classes began.

The college's founder and first president, Rev. Samuel Stanhope Smith, was subsequently the president of the College of New Jersey, which is currently Princeton University. Smith hired many faculty members from the College of New Jersey.

Hampden-Sydney became a thriving college in southside Virginia. In fact, the college s website states that  In its first fifty years the College prospered and gained the respect of the public and of the educational world.  This led to an expansion of the college. In 1812, the Union Theological Seminary was founded at Hampden-Sydney College. The Seminary was later moved to Richmond, VA and is currently the Union Theological Seminary & Presbyterian School of Christian Education. In 1838, the medical department of Hampden-Sydney College founded the Medical College of Virginia which is now the MCV Campus of Virginia Commonwealth University. During this time, the college constructed new buildings using Federal style architecture. This is the style of architecture still used on the campus.

At the onset of the American Civil War, Hampden-Sydney students formed a company in the Virginia Militia. The Hampden-Sydney students did not see much action but rather were  captured, and...paroled by General George B. McClellan on the condition that they return to their studies. 1.

The Campus.
The College has expanded from its original small cluster of buildings on 100 acres (0.4 km\B2\B2) to a campus of over 1000 acres (4 km\B2\B2). Prior to February 2006, the college owned 660 acres (2.7 km\B2\B2). In February 2006, the college purchased 400 acres (1.6 km\B2\B2) which include a lake and the historic location of the college s founding. The campus is host to numerous Federal style buildings. Part of the campus has been designated as a National Historic Preservation Zone. The campus has recently undergone major construction and renovation. In 2004 a new Fitness Center was completed in Kirby field house. During the summer of 2005, a new parking lot was constructed behind the alphabet dorms. The original parking lot for the alphabet dorms (directly across College Rd.) was torn out and filled in with dirt and grass. 

As of July 2006, the college s new library was halfway through construction. The new library is expected to be open for the Fall 2007 semester. As of July 2006, the college is also in the middle of construction of a FieldTurf field for the Hampden-Sydney lacrosse team. The field is scheduled to be completed in August 2006.

Lewis C. Everett of Kilmarnock, Virginia, has given Hampden-Sydney College $2.5 million to construct the Lewis C. Everett Stadium. Construction on the 1850-seat facility will begin in November 2006 and will be completed in August 2007. The Everett Stadium will replace the 40-year-old Hundley Stadium adjacent to Fulton Field.
