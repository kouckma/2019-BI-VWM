The Penny Hedge legend dates back to 1159. It is a legend and tradition in the English town of Whitby in Yorkshire.

The Abbot of Whitby imposed a penance on three hunters, and on their descendants for all time, for murdering a hermit at Eskdaleside.

On the shore, they had to construct a short hedge from stakes woven together. The instructions stipulated that a knife of a penny price is to be used.

The ceremony is still performed in Whitby every year on the eve of Ascension Day.
