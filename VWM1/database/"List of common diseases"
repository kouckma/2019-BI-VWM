This is a list of common, well-known or infamous diseases. This is neither complete nor authoritative. This is not intended to be a list of rare diseases, nor is it a list of mental disorders.

This list includes both common names and technical names for diseases. This is deliberate; where multiple names are in common use for the same disease, all of those names should link to the main article for the disease.

This list has been collated from various sources in the Wikipedia, and public domain resources. 

 A number of rare diseases may be present in this list. Unless they are notable for other reasons (for example, Ebola), please remove rare diseases from this list, and add them to the list of rare diseases if they are not already listed there.
