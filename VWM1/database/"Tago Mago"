Tago Mago, released in 1971 (originally as a double LP), was the third album by the krautrock band Can and the second to feature the vocals of Damo Suzuki. The name comes from a large rock formation off the coast of Ibiza that figures in the legend of Aleister Crowley. Tago Mago is generally considered the band's greatest album: it is groundbreaking, influential and deeply unconventional, based on intensely rhythmic jazz-inspired drumming, improvised guitar and keyboard soloing (frequently intertwining each other), tape edits, and Suzuki's idiosyncratic vocalisms. The album was recorded by Holger Czukay at Inner Space Studio, a converted movie theater near Cologne.
