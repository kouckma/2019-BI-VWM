Dame Marie Rambert (February 20, 1888   June 12, 1982) was a Polish-Jewish dancer and dance pedagogue who exerted a great influence on British ballet, both as a dancer and teacher. 

Born Cyvia or Miriam Ramberg in Warsaw, Poland, she also used a number of other names, including Rambach, Rambam.  Between 1912 and 1913 she collaborated with Les Ballets Russes led by Sergei Diaghilev. In 1918 she moved to the United Kingdom, where in 1920 she founded her own ballet school. In 1926 she created her own ballet company called Marie Rambert Dancers. Currently named Ballet Rambert, it is the oldest still active ballet company on British Isles. 

She cooperated in Millicent Hodson to restore Nijinsky's choreography of "The Rite of Spring" in 1979. The restoration of choreography was completed in 1987.
