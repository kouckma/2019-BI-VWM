F\E9lix Lajk\F3 (Serbian:             ) (born December 17, 1974 in Ba ka Topola, Vojvodina, Yugoslavia) is an ethnic Hungarian "world music" violinist and composer from Vojvodina. 

Lajk\F3's music is difficult to categorize; it is based on wide spectrum of influences of traditional string music from Pannonian plain. It can be viewed as a specific form of jazz, but based on traditional music of Hungary and Vojvodina.

He is a virtuoso violinist, playing with great fervor and passion, and occasionally he plays other traditional instruments, such as Cimbalom. On concerts, he usually performs with his small band, but sometimes also plays solo violin.
