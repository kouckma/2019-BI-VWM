Stan Seymour was a footballer who played and managed Newcastle United.

Seymour enjoyed a distinguished career at Newcastle until 1929, when he left after a disagreement with club officials. After leaving the club he became owner of a clothes shop and later a journalist. However his good service for Newcastle United were not forgotten and he was appointed the club's new Director in 1938.

As Director he had control of first-team affairs, but like Frank Watt could not pick the team under the Director's Committee. However he had more influence on who could play than Watt had during his time at the club. He was manager of the club with the Directors Committee from 1938-1954. The club won the FA Cup in 1951 and retained it in 1952 whilst Seymour was at the helm.

His son Stan Seymour Jnr later became chairman of Newcastle.
