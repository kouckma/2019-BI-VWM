Calcium phosphate is the name given to a family of minerals containing calcium ions (Ca2+) together with orthophosphates (PO43-), metaphosphates or pyrophosphates (P2O74-) and occasionally hydrogen or hydroxide ions.

Uses.
Calcium phosphate is an important raw material for the production of phosphoric acid and fertilizers, for example in the Odda process. Overuse of certain forms of calcium phosphate can lead to nutrient-containing surface runoff and subsequent adverse effects upon receiving waters such as algal blooms  and eutrophication.  

Calcium phosphate is also a raising agent, with E number E341. It is also used in cheese products. 

It is also used as a nutritional supplement.  There is some debate about the different bioavailabilities of the different calcium salts.

Another practical application of the compound is its use in gene transfection. The calcium ions can make a cell competent to allow exogenous genes to enter the cell by diffusion. A heat shock afterwards then induces the cell to repair itself. This is a quick and easy method for transfection, albeit a rather inefficient one.  Calcium chloride is also used for this purpose.
