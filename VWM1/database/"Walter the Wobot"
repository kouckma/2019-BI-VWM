Walter is a fictional character from the Judge Dredd comic strip in British comic 2000 AD.

Walter was Judge Dredd's house robot. He is usually used in stories to provide comic relief, and he has a speech impediment which causes him to pronounce his r's as w's. He was made a free robot with the rights of a human citizen in 2099 for his loyal services during the First Robot War. However he was so devoted to Dredd that he chose to remain in Dredd's employ, until he sustained serious damage at the hands of Mean Machine Angel. This was an effort by the writers to kill him off when Judge Dredd stories were becoming grittier and more mature. However, the character was brought back by John Wagner several years later.

In 2116 Walter attempted to lead a second Robot War, and actually shot Dredd to punish him for Dredd's harsh treatment of him over the years. Arrested by Rookie Judge Giant and sentenced to thirty years, he was paroled by Dredd in 2122 and now lives with Mrs Gunderson.

As well as numerous appearances in Judge Dredd, in 1978 Walter had his own eponymous comedy series (one-page episodes), in 2000 AD progs 50-61, 67-68, and 84-85.
