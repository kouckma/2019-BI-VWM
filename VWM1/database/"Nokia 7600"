The Nokia 7600 is a digital imaging mobile phone released by Nokia in the 3rd quarter of 2003.

The Nokia 7600 features an integrated digital VGA camera, capable of taking photos with a 640x480 resolution, and video clips of a 128x96 resolution (lasting up to 50 minutes). Videos and Photographs can be previewed on the phone's 65,536 colour TFT display, measuring 128x160 pixels.

It can hold 30MB of data on its internal memory for contact details (including a photographic phonebook), video clips, images, ringtones, messages, music files, calendar details, notes and Java applications.

The phone has many connectivity options, including infrared data transfer through its integrated port (located on the left side of the phone), Bluetooth wireless file transfer technology, MMS options and direct file transfer via a Nokia DKU-2 (Pop-Port-to-USB) cable to compatible PCs.

It also features a digital music player that supports both MP3 and AAC file formats, which can be used as ringing tones, as well as listened to through a stereo headset or the internal loudspeaker.

The 7600 has a dual mode operation mode on both the W-CDMA and GSM 900/1800 networks, and was the second Nokia phone which supported W-CDMA (2100 MHz) mobile networks (although the previous W-CDMA phone, the Nokia 6650, was only a prototype and never became widely used). Nokia's W-CDMA successor to the 7600 was the Nokia 6630 smartphone.

It is capable of high-speed data transfer up to 57.6 kilobits per second (in circuit switched data networks), as well as a 384 kbps download rate and 64 kbps upload rate (in W-CDMA packet transmission networks).
