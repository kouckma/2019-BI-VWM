Clouseau in 't lang is the name of the concert given by the Flemish band Clouseau in 2005 at the Antwerp Sportpaleis Merksem.  The name was inspired by the 6 meter wide, 40 meter long catwalk in the concert hall from which the band played.  This unusual arrangement made it possible for the entire hall to see the band more or less equally.

Video of the concert will be available on a DVD with the same name starting in February 2006.
