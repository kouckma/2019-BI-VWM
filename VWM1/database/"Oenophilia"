Oenophilia (IPA: ), originally from Greek, is the love (philia) of wine (oeno). An oenophile is a lover of wine. 

In the strictest sense, oenophilia describes a disciplined devotion to wine, accompanying strict traditions of consumption and appreciation. In a general sense however, oenophilia simply refers to the enjoyment of wine, often by laypersons.

Oenophiles are also known as a wine aficionados or connoisseurs. They are people who appreciate or collect wine, particularly grape wines from certain regions, varietal types, or methods of manufacture. While most oenophiles are normal, everyday people, some may also be vintners, wine merchants, or as in the case of Robert Parker, one who tastes and grades wines for a living. 

The oenophile stereotype is often used for comedic effect, a well-known example being the 2004 comedy Sideways.
