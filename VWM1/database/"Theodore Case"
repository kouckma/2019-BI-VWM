Theodore Willard Case (1888 Auburn, New York   1944) began working on his sound-on-film process in 1916. From 1922 to 1924, Case joined forces with Lee De Forest, working to integrate his system with De Forest's Phonofilm sound-on-film process, which had been patented by DeForest in 1919. 

On 15 April 1923, DeForest presented 18 short films made in the Phonofilm process at the Rivoli Theater in New York City. The printed program for this presentation gives credit to the "DeForest-Case Patents". However, Case and DeForest had a falling out, shortly after DeForest filed a lawsuit against Freeman Harrison Owens, another inventor who had worked with DeForest on sound-on-film systems. 

From 1926 to 1927, Case worked with Earl I. Sponable and movie mogul William Fox to develop the Fox Movietone process. Fox had previously purchased the rights to the sound film patents of Owens -- who had developed a sound movie camera as early as 1921 and coined the term "Movietone" -- and the U.S. rights to the German Tri-Ergon sound-on-film process.

Titles filmed by Case in his process, all made at the Case Studios in Auburn, New York, include Miss Manila Martin and Her Pet Squirrel (1921), Gus Visser and His Singing Duck (1925), Bird in a Cage (1923), Gallagher and Shean (1925), Madame Fifi (1925), and Chinese Variety Performer with a Ukelele (1925).
