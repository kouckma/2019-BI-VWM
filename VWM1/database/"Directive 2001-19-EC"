The Directive 2001/19/EC  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 May 2001 controls the general system for the recognition of professional qualifications of nurses responsible for general care, dental practitioners, veterinary surgeons, midwives, architects, pharmacists and doctors in the European Union.  

The Directive 2001/19/EC amends Council Directives 89/48/EC and 92/51/EC on the general system for the recognition of professional qualifications and Council Directives 77/452/EC, 77/453/EC, 78/686/EC, 78/697/EC, 78/1026/EC, 80/154/EC, 80/155/EC, 85/384/EC, 85/432, 85/433/EC and 93/16/EC concerning the above mentioned professions.
