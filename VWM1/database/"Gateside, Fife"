Gateside is a small village in the north east of Fife, Scotland. It is inhabited by around 200 people although a local housing development scheme wish to use a site in Gateside, (to the majority of residents dislike) to build many more houses. It also comprises a school, a pub, a church, a town hall and Minimart, selling  Mini and Smart cars.
The River Eden runs through the village, which flows to St Andrews and then into the North Sea.
The nearest large city is Perth, although Edinburgh is only half an hour away by car.
