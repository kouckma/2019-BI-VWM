Lyrics.

I wish I was in Carrickfergus,
Only for nights in Ballygrant;
I would swim over the deepest ocean,
For my love to find;

But the sea is wide and I cannot cross over;
And neither have I the wings to fly;
I wish I could meet a handsome boatsman;
To ferry me over, to my love and die;

My childhood days bring back sad reflections;
Of happy times I spent so long ago,
My boyhood friends and my own relations;
Have all passed on now like melting snow.

But I'll spend my days in endless roaming,
Soft is the grass, my bed is free.
Ah, to be back now in Carrickfergus,
On that long road down to the sea.

Now in Kilkenny, it is reported,
On marble stones there as black as ink;
With gold and silver I would support her,
But I'll sing no more 'till I get a drink.

For I'm drunk today, and I'm seldom sober,
A handsome rover from town to town,
Ah, but I'm sick now, my days are numbered,
Come all you young men and lay me down.
