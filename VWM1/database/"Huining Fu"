Huining Fu was a prefecture in the Shangjing region of Manchuria . It served as the first superior capital of the Jin Dynasty (1115-1234) between 1122 to 1234 (and was a secondary capital after 1173) until the capital was moved to Yanjing (now Beijing) in 1153 by Wanyan Liang, the fourth emperor of the dynasty, despite opposition from his ministers.

Ruins of the city were discovered and excavated at present-day Acheng in the Heilongjiang Province of the People's Republic of China. The site of the ruins is a national historic reserve and many of the artifacts found there are on display in nearby Harbin.
