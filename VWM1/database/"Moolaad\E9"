Moolaad\E9 is a 2004 African film by Senegalese director Ousmane Semb\E8ne. It addresses the subject of female circumcision, a common practice in most African countries. The film argues strongly against the practice, depicting a village woman, Colle, who uses moolaad\E9 (magical protection) to protect a group of girls. She is opposed by the villagers who believe in the necessity of circumcision, which they call 'purification'.

The film is a co-production between companies from several Francophone nations: Senegal, France, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Morocco and Tunisia.

The film won the Prix Un Certain Regard and a special mention in the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury at the Cannes Film Festival in 2004.
