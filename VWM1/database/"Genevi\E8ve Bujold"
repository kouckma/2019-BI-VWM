Genevi\E8ve Bujold (born July 1, 1942 in Montreal, Quebec) is a Canadian actress.

Related to 19th century Quebec strongman/weightlifter Louis Cyr, Bujold was raised by strict Roman Catholic French-Canadian parents who sent her to a convent school for her full twelve years of education. She disliked the school and its strict discipline, and eventually left it to pursue an acting career.

Dramatically trained at Montreal's Conservatory of Dramatic Art, she got her big break while on tour with a theatrical company in Paris, France when French director Alain Resnais selected her for a role opposite Yves Montand in La Guerre est finie (1966). This led to her staying in France for a time where she made more films with noted French directors such as Louis Malle.

Bujold appeared in a variety of film roles for Canadian and U.S. television earning a 1967 Emmy Award nomination for her performance as Joan of Arc in an NBC "Hallmark Hall of Fame" presentation. That year, she married Canadian film director Paul Almond, who directed her in Isabel (1968), and Act of the Heart (1970), opposite Donald Sutherland. They had a son Matthew in 1968 and were divorced in 1972. Also in 1968, she won the Prix Suzanne Bianchetti as the most promising young actress in French film.

In 1969, she starred opposite Richard Burton in the film, Anne of the Thousand Days. For her powerful performance, she won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a motion-picture drama as well as a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress.

Her considerable acting skills had the media touting her to become one of the brightest stars but Bujold's temperament led to run-ins with her employer Universal Studios and she walked away from her contract, resulting in a lawsuit (which was settled when she agreed to appear in the 1974 disaster film Earthquake). In the ensuing years she gave many sterling performances (in films such as The Trojan Women (1971, opposite Katharine Hepburn and Vanessa Redgrave), Kamouraska (1973), Brian De Palma's Obsession (1976), Alex and the Gypsy (1976, opposite Jack Lemmon), the medical thriller Coma (1978, opposite Michael Douglas), Choose Me (1984, directed by Alan Rudolph) and Tightrope (1984, directed by Clint Eastwood), but never reached the heights of movie stardom which many believed to be her due. She won the Best Actress in a Leading Role Genie Award for Murder by Decree (1979).

In 1994, she signed on to play the lead character, Captain Nicole Janeway, in the American television series Star Trek: Voyager. However she dropped out after filming just a few scenes of the series' first episode, stating that a TV series work schedule was too demanding. Kate Mulgrew replaced her and the character's name was changed to Kathryn Janeway.

Bujold   who spent several years away from her acting career after giving birth to a second son in 1980 (she re-emerged in the 1984 Alan Rudolph film Choose Me)   continues to work in film, primarily with independent production companies.
