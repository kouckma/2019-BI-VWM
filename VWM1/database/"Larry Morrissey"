Lawrence J. "Larry" Morrissey (Born in 1969 in Rockford, IL) is the Mayor of Rockford, IL.  As an independent, Morrissey defeated Democrat incumbent Doug Scott in the 2005 mayoral elections after trying in his first run in 2001 with a populist campaign promising road improvements, education reforms, and a revitalized downtown. Mayor Morrissey has struggled to accomplish some of his plan. His sales tax increase referendum was defeated soundly in the March 2006 primary and his effort to return "Home Rule" to Rockford was defeated on the floor of the Rockford City Council.  He has been successful at creating a department of lifelong learning, enacting a tough anti-truancy policy, and increasing enforcement of community standard ordinances.
