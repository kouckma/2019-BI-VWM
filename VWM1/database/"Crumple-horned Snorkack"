The Crumple-horned Snorkack is a magical creature of dubious existence that is incapable of flight. It is mentioned several times in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix by the character Luna Lovegood.  The only people who accept the existence of this creature appear to be Luna Lovegood, her father, and presumably certain fans of Mr Lovegood's magazine, The Quibbler.  According to Lovegood, some of these creatures can be found in Sweden. However, Hermione Granger doubts the existence of any Crumple-horned Snorkacks; they appear to be the magical equivalent of such dubious beings as the Loch Ness Monster or Yetis (though it should be noted that wizards accept these as completely real).   

Debate over the existence of Crumple-horned Snorkacks is the subject of occasional tension between Hermione and Luna, although so far, the creatures have not played major roles in the series.  Since most people do not believe Luna's claim that Crumple-horned Snorkacks do exist, they point to that claim as evidence of her weirdness.
