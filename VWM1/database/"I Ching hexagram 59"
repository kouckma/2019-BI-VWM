The Self-Referencing I Ching : using the I Ching to describe itself.
The following material is drawn from analysis of the binary sequence of the hexagrams where the hexagrams are derived from recursion of yin/yang and so showing a property of the method - the hexagrams are all linked together and contribute to the expression of, the description of, each hexagram.

 The skeletal form of hexagram 59 is described by analogy to the under-exaggerated properties of hexagram 60 where we have a generic focus on limits, setting standards. This vague sense of establishing standards sets a ground for a focus in 59 on dispelling illusions, lifting the 'fog', making things 'clear' etc.

The Lines:

Line 1- Help comes with the force of a horse. Try to resolve problems at the onset before they can develop.

Line 2- Disperse and grab that which supports you. Be flexible at the beginning of a crisis and look towards supportive allies.

Line 3- Dissolve yourself. Do not cling to your own image of yourself. Let go and you will become adaptable.

Line 4- He dissolves his bond with his group. By stepping back from the group, one can attain membership in a much larger group.

Line 5- Floods of perspiration, great cries as the king's house is flooded. Sometimes a cathartic flooding is necessary to resolve a situation.

Line 6- He dissolves his own blood. He leaves. Avoid danger. The way you react to external forces will shape who you are more than the external forces themselves.
