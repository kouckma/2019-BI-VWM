"American Tune" is a song written and first performed by Paul Simon. The song first appeared on Simon's second solo album following the breakup of Simon and Garfunkel, There Goes Rhymin' Simon (1973). It was also released as a single, Columbia 45900, backed with "One Man's Ceiling Is Another Man's Floor," which Simon released on the same album.

Lyrically, the song at the surface is an evocation of weariness and confusion, as the narrator describes being far from home and "wonder what's gone wrong." Metaphorically, the song may be addressing the perceived decline of American society as the lyrics include a dream image of the Statue of Liberty "sailing away to sea" and rueful mentions of the Mayflower and the Apollo program, before concluding "it's all right/You can't be forever blessed/Still tomorrow's going to be another working day/And I'm trying to get some rest."

Musically, the song is notable for being based on a melody line from Johann Sebastian Bach's chorale from "St. Matthew Passion," itself a reworking of an earlier secular song, "Mein Gm\FCth ist mir verwirret," composed by Hans Hassler.

Eventually it became a concert favorite, both for Simon and in reunion concerts with Simon's former singing partner Art Garfunkel (who has stated in concert that he wished that he and Simon had recorded this song before they split in 1970). The duo has claimed that had they not split, the song would have become another massive hit, similar to what "Bridge Over Troubled Water" had been. The song appears on several of Simon's solo live albums and on Simon and Garfunkel's post-breakup live albums, as well as many Simon compilation albums. The song has also been covered by many artists, notably Willie Nelson and Eva Cassidy.

The song was also featured on at least one episode of the NBC television series Providence.
