Transportation.

Most of the companies/organizations within SIPCOT have their own transportation, including buses, tempo travellers, and smaller vehicles, to ferry their employees. Very few people use private transportation for commuting to SIPCOT, possibly due to the great distance between SIPCOT and their homes.

No thoroughfare is allowed within SIPCOT. Only one MTC bus plies through SIPCOT: 21H Cut, which goes to/from the Biotech Park for Women's Society.

SIPCOT is located on Old Mahabalipuram Road, and public transport (MTC buses) are available at a bus stop just outside the gate. Taxis and autos are not easy to get around SIPCOT as of now.

The public buses that stop at SIPCOT are 19B (going to Saidapet), M19B (going to Thiruvanmiyur), and M5 (going to Adyar). All these buses originate at Kelambakkam). The bus 21H going to Broadway is a green board (express) bus that passes via the SIPCOT IT Park bus stop but does not stop at it.
