For the Vancouver highrise, see Palm Court (Vancouver).

A palm court is a large room, usually in a prestigious hotel, where functions are staged, notably tea dances.  Notable examples include the Ritz Hotel in London (pictured) and Alexandra Palace.

The concept of the palm court orchestra, a small orchestra playing light classical music, comes from this root.
