Rownd a Rownd is a television series on S4C. It was originally based on young people with paper rounds, but has since grown to include both their daily school and family life.

The series is filmed in Porthaethwy, Anglesey. An unrealistic factor about Rownd a Rownd is that it is filmed in the 
Summer months, but the story takes place in the Winter months, so it is always daylight in the morning, where darkness is expected.

The longest star of the series is Dewi 'Pws' Morris who has played the character of Islwyn Morgan, from the start in 1995.
