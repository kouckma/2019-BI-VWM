Brian owns a couple of guitars, most of which are his experimental pieces he plays around with in his own time. On stage, he uses only 2 guitars. They are the  99 Epiphone Les Paul Custom and a 2004 Gibson SG.

His pedal board configuration is always changing, but the few pedals that always seem to stay are the Ibanez Tubescreamer TS-9, Boss CS-3 Compressor and the Boss GE-7 Graphic Equalizer. Other pedals he has been seen using previously are the Boss DD-6 Digital Delay, Morley Mark Tremonti Wah Pedal, Sansamp GT2 and most notably, the Ibanez TS9DX FLEXI-4X2 that was stolen at one of his shows.


Soon is always seen at shows using a variety of different guitars. Besides the ESP Viper as his main piece, his on stage guitars include a  98 Epiphone Riviera,  96 Fender Stratocaster,  99 Fernandes Vertigo X and a  00 Epiphone SG G400.
